Sale Product set
================





Usage
=====

How to make sets:

    If this is your first set, just go to the products page and use the new button next to the add to cart button.
    This will create a set, add the product in it and show a new button on the navbar. You can keep adding products
    the same way and they will be added to the current set. The "Product set" button on the navbar will become green
    when you have a set in draft mode. You can only add products to sets that are in draft mode.

How to edit sets:

    To edit a set first go to "Product set" from the navbar, choose the set you want to edit and set it to draft mode.
    Now you can remove products from the set. If you want to add something else, just go to the products page and add
    the product you wish to add.
    You can also rename your set using the "Edit" button or make a clone of a set using the "Duplicate" button.
    When you are done with editing just put the set back in "Progress" mode.
    To remove the whole set just press the "Delete" button.
